Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you

Run away like it was yesterday
And we could run away
If we could run away
Run away from here

I gotta bulletproof heart
You gotta hollow point smile
We had our run away scarves
Got a photograph dream on the getaway mile

Let's blow a hole in this town
And do our talking with the laser beam
Coming out of this place
In a bullet's embrace
Then we'll do it again

How can they say, Jenny could you come back home?
'Cause everybody knows you don't
Ever wanna come back
Let me be the one to save you

Gravity don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you

Run away like it was yesterday
When we could run away
When we could run away, run away from here
